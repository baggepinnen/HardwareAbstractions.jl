Generate a logarithmic (default) or linear chirp signal betweem frequencies `f0` and `f1` over a time `Tf`.

A logarithmic chirp has roughly the same number of periods for each frequency, while a linear chirp spends roughly the same amount of time for each frequency. Most of the time, you want a logarithmic chirp, in order to get the same amount of information for each frequency.
